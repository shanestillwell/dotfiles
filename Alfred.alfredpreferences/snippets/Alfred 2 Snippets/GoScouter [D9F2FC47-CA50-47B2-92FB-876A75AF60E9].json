If this is an oversight, please let me know and I'll get you the link to make a payment.\n\nYour feedback about GoScouter is very valuable, no matter why, I'd love to hear the reason you are no longer using GoScouter.  Missing a key feature? Not a good value? No longer used by your unit? What ever the reason, please drop me a quick reply why you no longer use GoScouter.\n\nThank you for your time,",
